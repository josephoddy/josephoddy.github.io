    "text": "PhD Research\n\n  \n\nThe Rothamsted team in the gene-edited trial\n\n\nI completed my PhD at Rothamsted Research with Nigel Halford (along with partners at the University of Reading and Mondelez International) on the genetic and agronomic control of free asparagine accumulation in wheat. The projects I carried out are described in more detail below.\nI also helped my team undertake analysis of the first field trial of gene-edited wheat in Europe. The scientific article can be read here and some of the media coverage can be seen here.\n\nInvestigating natural diversity in the asparagine synthetase family\nIn collaboration with a group at Colorado State University, we investigated a deletion of one of the wheat asparagine synthetase genes (TaASN-B2) and how this impacts grain asparagine content in the field. Our paper on this is available here and code/data is available here.\n\n\nFinding stable QTL for quality traits and amino acids\nUsing a soft wheat mapping population developed in collaboration with John Innes Centre and Limagrain, we investigated stable QTL for asparagine and other quality traits that can be incorporated into breeding programs. I also looked at the capacity for genomic prediction to be used for these traits and leveraged recently released wheat pangenome resources to identify underlying candidate genes controlling lysine content. The article from this work is available here. The data is available at Dryad here and the code is available at Zenodo here.\n\n\nGrowing low asparagine wheat\n\n  \n\nOur JAFC cover\n\n\nIn combination with the above genetic studies, I also investigated the agronomic control (with varying rates of nitrogen, sulphur, potassium, and phosphorus fertiliser) of free asparagine in two field trials. In parallel, I looked into whether multispectral measurements of plants and grain could be used to predict asparagine content. The impact of these factors on end products was also assessed by baking biscuits (since we were investigating soft wheat) at the Mondelez laboratories in Reading and analysing their acrylamide content.\nThe article from this work is available here and code/data is available here.\nOur photograph of biscuits with varying acrylamide content (ranging from low to high from light to darker colour) was selected for the cover of this issue of JAFC.\n\n\nNeural networks for prediction of grain asparagine content\nI re-analysed data from my PhD (see below) to assess the accuracy of neural networks for prediction of grain asparagine content from imaging data. The results of this analysis are available on bioRxiv here."
